The ROIC Effect

Overview:

This repository explores the hypothesis that companies with a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) consistently above 10% for 3 consecutive years are fundamentally strong and tend to outperform the market. The goal is to test this hypothesis through data-driven backtesting and analysis of financial and stock performance metrics.

By leveraging historical ROIC data and stock price movements, this project aims to determine whether ROIC can be a reliable predictor of long-term investment success.

Key Objectives:

1) Analyze ROIC Trends: Calculate and visualize ROIC for companies over the past three years to identify patterns.
2) Backtest Strategy: Evaluate stock performance (1-year, 3-year, and 5-year returns) for companies meeting the ROIC threshold (>10% for 3 consecutive years).
3) Benchmark Performance: Compare returns against a market index (e.g., S&P 500) to assess the strategyâ€™s effectiveness.
4) Draw Insights: Determine whether high ROIC is a strong indicator of a company's financial health and potential for outperformance.

Data Sources:

Yahoo Finance: Used to fetch financial statements (Operating Income, Invested Capital) and historical stock prices.

Methodology:

1) Data Collection
   - Retrieve quarterly and annual financial data for selected companies.
   - Extract Operating Income and Invested Capital directly from financial statements.
2) ROIC Calculation
   - Calculate ROIC for the last three years.
   - Identify companies with ROIC consistently >10%.
3) Backtest
   - Measure stock returns after the 3-year ROIC period.
   - Compare performance against a benchmark index.
4) Visualization
   - Create intuitive charts for ROIC trends and stock performance.
   - Highlight patterns and key findings.

Results:

- Hypothesis Validation: Companies with consistently high ROIC are correlated with strong stock performance.
- ROIC trends provide early signals for potential outperformance.

Future Work:

- Expand the analysis to include more companies and industries.
- Explore additional financial metrics (e.g., Free Cash Flow, Earnings Growth).
- Implement machine learning models to predict future ROIC trends.
